# Sirken Bot v0.3 
##They say I give *respawn times*.

Interactive discord bot who stores and updates times of death, pops and let the user set timers for ETA

Please don't fork me, create new branches instead.\
Use pipenv for required python version and dependencies.\
No copyright indeed, feel free to use wherever you want.
